# Nexora-
Why I want to work at Nexora
Honestly, Nexora feels like the kind of place where what I’m already building lines up perfectly with what’s next. I’ve been working hands-on with AI models—embedding generation, vector search, model evaluation, and GenAI workflows—so the idea of a vibe-based recommendation engine isn’t just exciting, it’s familiar territory. My recent work involved prototyping a similar mini rec-system that used OpenAI embeddings, cosine similarity, and multiple retrieval strategies to match products by mood or intent. Beyond coding, I enjoy shaping AI systems that feel human—turning abstract “vibes” into quantifiable data that can power real-world personalization. Nexora’s focus on blending fashion, AI, and influencer discovery feels like a rare intersection of creativity and applied machine learning where my technical background in Python, ML, NLP, and deep learning can actually make something tangible and fun for users.
How my innovation aligns with Nexora’s expectations
In my prototype, I designed three complementary retrieval strategies—each optimized for a different trade-off:
Fast method – Uses only pre-normalized description embeddings for ultra-low latency searches. Ideal for real-time vibe lookups.
Accurate method – Combines product descriptions, vibe embeddings, and tag-overlap scores. It sacrifices some speed for higher semantic precision.
Hybrid method – A two-stage pipeline: fast pre-filter + accurate re-ranking. It balances speed and accuracy, similar to how a production system would scale with Pinecone or other vector databases.
Together, these approaches show three engineering mindsets—speed, precision, and balance—which directly map to how Nexora is experimenting with scalable, vibe-aware recommendations. The design also mirrors the internship goals: embedding generation, vector search integration, latency evaluation, and GenAI-driven refinements—all within one reproducible notebook setup.
