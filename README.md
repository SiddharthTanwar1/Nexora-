# Why I Want to Work at Nexora

Honestly, Nexora feels like the kind of place where what I’m already building lines up perfectly with what’s next.  
I’ve been working hands-on with AI models—embedding generation, vector search, model evaluation, and GenAI workflows—so the idea of a *vibe-based recommendation engine* isn’t just exciting, it’s familiar territory.  

My recent work involved prototyping a similar mini recommendation system that used OpenAI embeddings, cosine similarity, and multiple retrieval strategies to match products by mood or intent. Beyond coding, I enjoy shaping AI systems that feel *human*—turning abstract “vibes” into quantifiable data that can power real-world personalization.  

Nexora’s focus on blending fashion, AI, and influencer discovery feels like a rare intersection of creativity and applied machine learning where my technical background in Python, ML, NLP, and deep learning can actually make something tangible and fun for users.

# Innovation in My Approach

In my prototype, I designed **three complementary retrieval strategies**, each optimized for a specific trade-off:

1. **Fast Method**  
   Uses only pre-normalized description embeddings for ultra-low latency searches.  
   Ideal for real-time vibe lookups.

2. **Accurate Method**  
   Combines product descriptions, vibe embeddings, and tag-overlap scores.  
   Sacrifices some speed for higher semantic precision.

3. **Hybrid Method**  
   A two-stage pipeline: fast pre-filter + accurate re-ranking.  
   Balances speed and accuracy, similar to how a production system would scale with Pinecone or other vector databases.

Together, these approaches demonstrate three core engineering mindsets—**speed**, **precision**, and **balance**—which directly map to Nexora’s goals of building scalable, vibe-aware recommendations.  
The design also mirrors the internship expectations: embedding generation, vector search integration, latency evaluation, and GenAI-driven refinements—all within one reproducible notebook framework.
